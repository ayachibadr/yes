Both eventually get traffic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in the end, one fails and the others succeed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And guess who wins?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You guessed right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-large\"><img width=\"640\" height=\"426\" src=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3812761.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-173\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3812761.jpg 640w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3812761-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Success in blogging is not about how many articles you write and publish. It\u2019s not even about the number of subscribers, backlinks or traffic acquired, but about the people you transformed through your blog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experts stick, they have a way of gaining prominence and standing out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to be one of them, then you should learn to stick. Period!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No mincing words.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that is the only thing you are able to take away from this, then I have achieved the intention behind this post.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do I stick?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you just asked that question then you are asking the right question.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can learn it right now. In a few easy steps you\u2019ll discover how to be unforgettable, gain massive comments and shares.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here\u2019s how to stick on the minds of your readers:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-1-change-their-reality\"><strong>1. Change Their Reality<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When readers visit your blog, they indirectly give you an opportunity to speak with them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the truth is, many lies are being sold in the blogosphere\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I joined the blogosphere, I was told <em>content is king<\/em> and that <em>the more traffic I get the more money I\u2019ll make<\/em> but those are all lies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Honestly, that\u2019s not what matters at least for newbie bloggers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what does matter?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Build solid and long lasting relationships with people that matter by writing epic contents they can relate with, focus on building your list using pillar and writing articles through guest posting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sit, relax and watch your fame soar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-2-change-their-attitude\"><strong>2. Change their attitude<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As bloggers, we have a singular objective which is to impact and transform the lives of our readers. And it begins by them having a change towards what they do, a change in attitude.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, I would have changed your attitude if I can make you cultivate the habit of writing daily, it could also be encouraging you to invest 1 hour daily to write Instead of writing for 30 minutes. I will be helping you write valuable and insightful blog posts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Isn\u2019t that what you were put here to do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-large\"><img width=\"640\" height=\"426\" src=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3812721.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-174\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3812721.jpg 640w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3812721-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let your readers see things as they are and change positively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do that, they\u2019ll respect you, if you do that; they\u2019ll listen to whatever you say henceforth, that is not even all, they will become raving fans, become your marketer &#8211; sharing your blog article without pay.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who doesn\u2019t like pro-bono?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-3-give-them-mental-movies\"><strong>3. Give Them Mental Movies<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The human brain craves images and processes it 700 times faster than text.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprise?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, that\u2019s the fact, if you want to stick in the minds of your readers, then you must create and direct mental movies in your post.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Transform a bland sentence into an enticing movie, for example; instead of saying \u201cI love to cook noodles\u201d you can say \u201cI love to cook delicious mouth-watering, salad garnished noodles with my yummy chicken\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interesting, huh?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you do this, you are engaging with their emotions, because of this, they\u2019ll remember you forever.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-4-use-the-power-of-simple\"><strong>4. Use the Power of SIMPLE<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s be frank, there\u2019s no point writing a post no one understands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you really desire fame, if you want to be remembered, be down to earth, simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever can be simplified shouldn\u2019t be left hanging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Break it into simple terms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t be like my friend who enjoy using complex words when writing, he feels it makes him look like a professional. The other day I saw him use the word \u201centerprise solution\u201d instead of a simple \u201cbusiness\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Write as though you are writing to a friend, ask questions, break the news and share the joy. Your readers would care and share everything you post.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The secret?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simplicity and clarity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\u2019s the point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-5-induce-fear-and-courage\"><strong>5. Induce Fear and Courage<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, every man has this seven primary needs:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The need for survival and enjoyment of food<\/li><li>Freedom from fear, pain and danger<\/li><li>The need for sexual companionship<\/li><li>A comfortable living condition<\/li><li>The feeling of superiority<\/li><li>Care, protection and<\/li><li>Social approval.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Who could argue these things? You and I also desire them, don\u2019t we?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But guess what?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The strongest and most important of them all is <strong><em>freedom from fear, pain and danger.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-large\"><img width=\"640\" height=\"426\" src=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3812729.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-175\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3812729.jpg 640w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3812729-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to quickly stick and be remembered, use the fear factor. Appeal to your readers&#8217; fear and then point out solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one secret used by ads agencies to win more clients and gain influence. And I could bet only a few bloggers are using this right now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point? Induce fear but finish with strong courage and hope.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey, here\u2019s the golden rule!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t ever use this if you aren\u2019t going to put smiles back on their faces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It simply means, you are not only looking out for solutions, rather your post should address both problems and then finally the solution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-5-show-credibility-and-proof\"><strong>5. Show Credibility and Proof<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is important because people would easily listen to people who have real proof of what they are talking about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t go waging what others say or believe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let your readers see you\u2019re the right person for the problems they need help with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Show them how you\u2019ve helped yourself and others and how you can help them too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The bottom line:<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to stick in the mind of your readers, then prove it and let them handle the rest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-6-create-your-own-style\"><strong>6.

We all want to stick around and motivate the world, even after we are far gone into the world beyond.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember some months ago, a friend Andres Morgan launched an app to promote reading culture targeted directly at a community in Sub Saharan Africa.

This is the only thing that matters at the end of our lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s your turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Give yourself to learning and write quality content, so you\u2019ll be remembered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can do it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, hit the ground running already..<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s deeply annoying isn\u2019t it?
