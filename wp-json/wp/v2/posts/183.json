It doesn&#8217;t exist. A domain name is how internet users identify your website. It is a part of a URL that directs people to your website or different parts of your website. For example, the domain name for High Blog Traffic is highblogtraffic.com but the URL that directs you to this article which is part of this website is <em><span class=\"has-inline-color has-theme-palette-5-color\">https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/building-wordpress-websites\/<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-have-you-chosen-a-domain-name-yet\">Have You Chosen a Domain Name Yet?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing a domain name can be such stress, considering many factors to take note of when doing so. You must make sure you are not infringing on any rights when choosing a domain name in building WordPress websites. Once that is settled, you are halfway into choosing a domain name.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m guessing you have a business name or brand already which you would want the website to represent. You can derive your domain name from the name of your local business, you just have to be sure it is not yet taken. You can check your brand name for a domain name with different domain providers or web hosting providers to see if it is available. Don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll get to that soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One big rule to remember when choosing a domain name is to keep it simple, short, and easy to remember. This always works, but a brand strategy will come in handy too. Your domain name can directly represent the objective of your website, just like highblogtraffic.com.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve decided on a domain name for your website, you must then make move to buy the domain name, making it your digital property. We&#8217;ll circle back to buying a domain name in a bit. First, let&#8217;s help you choose a web hosting provider.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-choosing-a-web-hosting-provider\">Choosing A Web Hosting Provider<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When I talk about building a website, I like to describe it as building a house, that is, a digital address on the internet that you and your business can be located. To build a house, you&#8217;ll need a piece of land to build on. In building WordPress websites, you need web hosting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized is-style-default\"><img src=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/post-image_file-Questions-You-Must-Ask-Your-Web-Hosting-Provider-1024x538.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-203\" width=\"758\" height=\"398\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/post-image_file-Questions-You-Must-Ask-Your-Web-Hosting-Provider-1024x538.png 1024w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/post-image_file-Questions-You-Must-Ask-Your-Web-Hosting-Provider-300x158.png 300w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/post-image_file-Questions-You-Must-Ask-Your-Web-Hosting-Provider-768x403.png 768w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/post-image_file-Questions-You-Must-Ask-Your-Web-Hosting-Provider-1536x806.png 1536w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/post-image_file-Questions-You-Must-Ask-Your-Web-Hosting-Provider.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-is-web-hosting\">What is Web Hosting?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, Web hosting is a service that allows you to store the data and files that make up your websites on a server. It&#8217;s like a garage service that allows you to park in your car for a specific period, for a fee, only this time, It&#8217;s your website. It&#8217;s like renting a space. More like a digital warehouse to safely store up the files and data of your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-3-hosting-packages-you-might-want-to-consider-for-starters\">3 Hosting packages you might want to consider for starters.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are different web hosting packages that you can choose from to host your website. These packages come with different offers that are tailored to meet your needs and budget. So, you get to choose a hosting package based on the website you want to build and your budget.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing a web hosting package can sometimes be a headache even for the big boys, but here are 3 options for you to choose from to build websites using WordPress:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shared Hosting<br>Virtual Private Server (VPS)<br>Managed WordPress Hosting<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-shared-hosting\">Shared Hosting<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"483\" src=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Shared-Hosting-6-1024x483.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-206\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Shared-Hosting-6-1024x483.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Shared-Hosting-6-300x142.jpg 300w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Shared-Hosting-6-768x362.jpg 768w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Shared-Hosting-6.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Many Web hosting providers offer the option of shared hosting that allows hundreds of websites to be hosted on a single server, thus making it very affordable. Because this option allows hundreds of websites to be housed on a single server, the cost of hosting is therefore shared by the users. For this reason, you can get a shared hosting package for a low as $5.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like having a next next-door neighbour with who you get to share the general cost of building maintenance. It is the perfect option if you are on a very tight budget, but it sure comes with its disadvantages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because there are over hundreds of websites hosted on a single server, there is usually the problem of security and poor uptime when you build websites using WordPress on Shared Hosting. An attack on one website can easily affect every other user on the server without any warning. Your website can technically go down at any time due to the limited available memory and unpredictable events.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A single user can take up to 70% of the memory space, leaving hundreds of other users to scramble for what&#8217;s left. I mean, you can imagine your website going down just while a customer or a potential client is checking you out. You definitely wouldn&#8217;t want that to happen, would you?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-virtual-private-servers-vps\">Virtual Private Servers (VPS)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/VPN-hosting-1024x512.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-205\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/VPN-hosting-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/VPN-hosting-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/VPN-hosting-768x384.jpg 768w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/VPN-hosting.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is just like the shared hosting package, but a bit better. The VPS hosting package option allows multiple users on a single server, but this time, the hardware is evenly partitioned among a fewer number of users on the same server.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a better version of the shared hosting package with most, if not all, of its downsides taken away. It gives you the chance to do more with your own space on the server, reduces the risk of attacks from other users, and gives better server administration options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, you get to pay up to 3 times the amount you would for a shared hosting option. This is worth it, considering the better security, reduced uncertainty, and super flexibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-managed-wordpress-hosting\">Managed WordPress Hosting<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"428\" src=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-managed-wordpress-hosting-1024x428.png\" alt=\"Build websites using wordpress\" class=\"wp-image-204\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-managed-wordpress-hosting-1024x428.png 1024w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-managed-wordpress-hosting-300x125.png 300w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-managed-wordpress-hosting-768x321.png 768w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/best-managed-wordpress-hosting.png 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here comes the easy deal, the managed WordPress hosting. This option works perfectly for building WordPress websites. It&#8217;s like getting the whole server from WordPress, thus every bit of the website is structured to work with WordPress. This option offers better security and makes your websites a lot faster than when hosted using the other options. With managed WordPress hosting, building websites using WordPress becomes even easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since all skeletal structure of your website is configured to best work with WordPress, you might have a tiny bit of trouble installing other systems and plugins not approved by the host. Simply put, it reduces your flexibility, but ensure your website functions at its best based on what the host, considers to be efficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I usually would recommend this option for users who do not have the knowledge, skill and time for sophisticated server settings and installations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-web-hosting-providers-you-can-choose-from\">Web Hosting Providers You Can Choose From<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There a quite a lot of web hosting providers you could choose from. Again, this will be based on what you need for your website, and your budget too. Whatever project you are considering, we have carefully selected a list of reputable hosting companies that will fit your project. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/go\/a2-hosting\/\">A2 Hosting<\/a><\/em><br><a href=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/go\/bluehost\/\">Bluehost<\/a><br><a href=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/go\/siteground\/\">SiteGround<\/a><br><a href=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/go\/wp-engine\/\">WPEngine<\/a><br><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The web hosting provider you choose is very important to the success of your project, so you need to choose the right one. Relax, we will guide you on which might help your project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kindly note that when you click any of the links above, you&#8217;ll be buying through our affiliate link and we would be paid a little commission for our recommendation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-buying-a-web-hosting-package\">Buying A Web Hosting Package<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We know it is quite difficult to choose which hosting you should go for, while you are looking for the best hosting that will fit your website, you are also concerned about a budget that will suit your purse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After using several web-hosting for about a decade now for our businesses and our clients, we have experience with good hostings that fit any project whatsoever.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a very small budget and you&#8217;re looking to maximize every penny you can get, you want to build a project that you are giving time to grow, then Bluehost is highly recommended<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in quality and you are ready to sacrifice a little more then A2 Hosting and Siteground is the go-to. However, I must let you know that Siteground to me is unreasonably too pricey. They have an amazing fast server quite frankly, but you will pay through your nose for it. A2 hosting on the other hand will give you the same at a relatively cheap price.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, If you are looking at a big project, perhaps you have a website already that is getting tons of views or you have a brand that is big and you want something that can match your brand with quality and excellence and you are ready to pay for it, then no one does it better than WP Engine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A2 Hosting is our recommended hosting right now, it just became the perfect fit for anything serious online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of our blogs got hit terribly by a Google Algorithm update sometime last year and the only thing we did to fix the issue was migrating to a better server which was A2 Hosting. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google loves sites that are user friendly, and speed is almost everything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A2 Hosting is our recommended hosting company today for anyone serious about how to build WordPress website. They have an amazing pricing plan that won&#8217;t break the bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-default\"><img width=\"997\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/a2hosting-pricing.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-215\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/a2hosting-pricing.jpg 997w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/a2hosting-pricing-300x206.jpg 300w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/a2hosting-pricing-768x526.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 997px) 100vw, 997px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-our-awesome-bonus-offer\">Our Awesome Bonus Offer<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you buy through our affiliate link, you will get 65% off. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is not the only offer we are giving out today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are generous enough to buy any hosting above through our affiliate link we would also be generous enough to give you a free coupon for our <a href=\"https:\/\/websitedesignmastery.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WordPress Training Course<\/a> for free.

This is because WordPress has a drag and drop feature that makes it easy to build websites using WordPress. On some web hosting servers, installing WordPress can be as easy as just a few clicks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-default\"><img width=\"861\" height=\"735\" src=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/a2hosting-wordpress-install.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-219\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/a2hosting-wordpress-install.jpg 861w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/a2hosting-wordpress-install-300x256.jpg 300w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/a2hosting-wordpress-install-768x656.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 861px) 100vw, 861px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A2 hosting took this to another level, you would not even need to lift a finger after checkout, with their auto-install application feature, you select what application you love to install, they&#8217;ve got quite a number.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The A2 optimized application will not only auto-install WordPress but will auto-optimize it for speed, and you get to have your WordPress admin details even before you checkout.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How cool can that be?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do not forget to save your WordPress admin details. I love to copy it into my sticky note on my desktop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another awesome feature you get with A2 Hosting is that you get to choose your server location, as you see highlighted in the image above.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is what many get wrong, do not choose a server closest to you, rather closest to your website visitors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter where I am, if my websites visitors are in Europe or the majority of them are in Europe, that is where my server should be, even if I am in The US.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can create multiple websites on your A2 Hosting account by going to the addon section of your Cpanel,  add new domains as an addon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons alignwide is-content-justification-center\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button has-custom-width wp-block-button__width-100 is-style-fill\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/go\/a2-hosting\/\">Buy A2 Hosting today and get 65% off<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-selecting-and-installing-a-theme-to-design-your-website\">Selecting And Installing A Theme To Design your Website<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You are almost there now.

With just a few clicks, you can get the best plugins needed for a great user experience on your website. Allow me to help you install your first plugin with these few steps:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Click on your WordPress <strong><em>admin dashboard<\/em><\/strong> and then click on <strong><em>Plugins <\/em><\/strong>to view the plugins already installed on your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"469\" src=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Plugins-min-1024x469.png\" alt=\"build websites using wordpress\" class=\"wp-image-193\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Plugins-min-1024x469.png 1024w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Plugins-min-300x137.png 300w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Plugins-min-768x351.png 768w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Plugins-min.png 1414w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Click on <strong><em>add new<\/em><\/strong> to view the WordPress database of plugins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Type in the name of your plugins or the functionality you are looking for, and then hit the <strong><em>search<\/em><\/strong> button.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Click on <strong><em>install<\/em><\/strong> to install the plugin and once done, click on <strong><em>activate<\/em><\/strong> to get it running on your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"447\" src=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/plugins-2-min-1024x447.png\" alt=\"Build websites using wordpress\" class=\"wp-image-194\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/plugins-2-min-1024x447.png 1024w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/plugins-2-min-300x131.png 300w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/plugins-2-min-768x335.png 768w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/plugins-2-min.png 1397w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s it! You just installed a plugin on your WordPress website. You can also at any moment deactivate or uninstall a plugin if you feel it&#8217;s affecting the speed of your website or you find it less satisfactory and want to change to another plugin. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All you need to do is return to your plugin page from your WordPress admin dashboard, locate the plugin you which to remove, then click on <strong><em>deactivate<\/em><\/strong> or <strong><em>uninstall<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-setting-up-important-web-pages-for-building-wordpress-website\">Setting Up Important web pages For Building WordPress Website<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another necessity in building WordPress websites are web pages. Every website, irrespective of what kind of website they are, must have certain web pages that present basic information and details for readers and visitors. Now that you have installed your themes and plugins, you should have the following web pages running on your WordPress website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Home Page<\/strong> &#8211; The home page is where your readers will land when they type in your domain name on a browser or just click on your link. <strong>It&#8217;s the central location of your websites.<\/strong> It&#8217;s like the sitting room where you welcome readers and visitors to your website, so it must carry a bit of everything necessary to give a great first impression to your reader.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About page<\/strong> &#8211; This page is <strong>where your readers go to find out all they need to know about you, your business, or your website.<\/strong> It contains details of your product and services, goals and objectives, team and members, services partners, and departments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Contact Page<\/strong> &#8211; Just as the name implies, this is <strong>where your visitors go to get your contact details or leave a message<\/strong> for you. If you have WPForms installed on your WordPress website, your contact page should show a form that allows visitors to leave their contact details with you through an interactive form. This is very necessary when you build websites using WordPress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-how-to-setup-web-pages-on-wordpress\">How To Setup web-pages On WordPress<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Go to your WordPress admin dashboard and click on <strong><em>Pages<\/em><\/strong>, and the <strong><em>Add new<\/em><\/strong> to display the image below and edit and your contents accordingly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\"><img width=\"712\" height=\"356\" src=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/WordPress-add-page.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-192\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/WordPress-add-page.png 712w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/WordPress-add-page-300x150.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 712px) 100vw, 712px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>(1) Title<\/strong> &#8211; Here, you should type in the title for the page. E.g About<br><strong>(2) The body section<\/strong> \u2013 You should type in the main content of the page here. You can copy and paste your text from another document or just feel free to type your text.<br><strong>(3) Add Image<\/strong> &#8211; You can add images by clicking this button.<br><strong>(4) Text or Visual<\/strong> &#8211; Switch between the Text and Visual editors. Since you are not quite conversant with HTML codes, you should leave this on visual while you add your text to the body of the page.<br><strong>(5) Publish Section<\/strong> &#8211; The Publish section is where you make your page go live when you are done.<br><strong>(6) Discussion<\/strong> &#8211;  You can make settings for comments here. Make sure you have it ticked if you wish to receive comments on your web pages. I will advise you don&#8217;t allow comments if you don&#8217;t have time to manage spam, a lot of them. The &#8220;trackbacks and ping-backs&#8221; setting you can leave unchecked too.<br><strong>(7) Featured image<\/strong> &#8211; For this, you might not need to worry. Most WordPress themes have default featured images and display for certain pages, but you can change them to your taste from here<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you followed every step of this guide, building WordPress websites should be a walk in the part for you.
