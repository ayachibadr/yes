An email list is one of the most important blogging assets and most bloggers advise you to build it up from day one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only problem?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They don\u2019t tell you what to do to make your readers actually take that action. They also forget to tell you step by step how to implement the strategies they offer. And it\u2019s terribly annoying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And maybe that\u2019s why you aren\u2019t seeing it as valuable. That\u2019s why you aren\u2019t taking it seriously. And that\u2019s why your list isn\u2019t growing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, here\u2019s the thing&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you take list building seriously, it\u2019ll eventually mean the difference between success and failure for your blogging business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you don\u2019t know, your list is a profitable asset. They are your future customers who will someday pay your bills and send you on vacation to the Bahamas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They aren\u2019t signing up no matter what you say or do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t worry. This post is a quick fix to get subscribers begging to get on your flight. And it all boils down to 5 easy steps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to know how?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-consider-your-placement\"> Consider Your Placement <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ve probably heard this advice, \u201cPlace your newsletter form somewhere on your blog and visitors will locate it and sign up to get weekly updates.,\u201d or \u201cPlace the form on your sidebar,\u201d and maybe \u201cGet another popup staring at readers in the face.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a good idea, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, wrong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>List building is now far beyond all that. Today it\u2019s about being strategic and more deliberate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you want to ask, Where do I place them? A smart question.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the answer?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are 9 strategic places on your blog that give high (CTR) and they work like a charm in getting readers clicking. So let\u2019s look at them quickly:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-top-featured-box\"> Top Featured Box: <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you considered placing it above the fold of your blog? Aha! Chances are you have not even given it a thought. But listen, it is generally proven that blogs with optin boxes convert more traffic. Here\u2019s what it looks like in real life on Smart Blogger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"519\" src=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/az1-1024x519.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-332\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/az1-1024x519.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/az1-300x152.jpg 300w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/az1-768x389.jpg 768w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/az1.jpg 1371w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Because that\u2019s the first thing readers get to see when they land on your blog. It welcomes and pulls them in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get a featured box on your blog and watch your list grow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-top-sidebar\"> Top Sidebar: <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sidebars are the next most important spot to get a SignUp form. In fact, it\u2019s the most common I have seen on blogs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I am not a fan of sidebars anymore and I have not used them on any blog In recent years. I just think it has been overused. This doesn&#8217;t take away the fact many bloggers still use it because it converts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, to get your visitors to opt-in, you should get one or two up and running. Neil Patel\u2019s sidebar has more than one, giving the visitor multiple opportunities to subscribe. Also, See how he smartly positioned his call to action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"482\" src=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/az2-1024x482.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-333\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/az2-1024x482.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/az2-300x141.jpg 300w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/az2-768x361.jpg 768w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/az2-1536x723.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/az2.jpg 1585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-about-page\"> About Page <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This page on your blog is one of the prominent and most visited pages on your blog. When you provide value, your readers want to know more about you. It\u2019s an opportunity to let them in on your offers. See an example on Backlinko.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"694\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/az3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-334\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/az3.jpg 694w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/az3-300x295.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-pop-ups\"> Pop-Ups <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael Dunlop of incomedairy.com uses a popup to increase subscriptions to up 200%. I discovered prominent bloggers are also using it:, Jon Morrow, Darek Halpin, Yaro Starek, Jeff Bullas, and yours truly, all raking in hundreds of subscribers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s annoying, granted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with a sizzling and breathtaking offer, you\u2019re the boss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-after-the-post\"> After The Post <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Increase your chances of getting more signups by adding a form just after your post. It&#8217;s an emotional game, always play the damn out of it. Anyone who just finished reading helpful content from you would be happy to want more from you. Just align your boxes nicely just after the post.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See how we did that here:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"793\" height=\"679\" src=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/After-post-optin-highblogtraffic.com_.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-335\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/After-post-optin-highblogtraffic.com_.jpg 793w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/After-post-optin-highblogtraffic.com_-300x257.jpg 300w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/After-post-optin-highblogtraffic.com_-768x658.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-hello-bar\"> Hello Bar <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Positioned at the very top of your blog can help increase the chances of getting readers clicking and getting them on board.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are seen and get noticed before any other Optin box on the page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-the-footer\"> The Footer <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When readers read your blog post to the end, they are presented with an Optin form that throws a SignUp opportunity at them. It\u2019s great because that\u2019s the last opportunity they have before walking away. Come on, why not utilize that spot? Get your readers in by placing one. See how Pat Flynn used his footer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"579\" src=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/az4-1024x579.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-336\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/az4-1024x579.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/az4-300x170.jpg 300w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/az4-768x434.jpg 768w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/az4.jpg 1252w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bottom line?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your placements are as important as the email lists building in itself. Get it wrong, and you are screwed. And you can keep hitting your head against the rock and hoping for miracles\u2026 but no matter how you try it\u2019s never going to work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-display-irresistible-benefits\"> Display Irresistible Benefits <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want more sign-ups, your subscription boxes or pages need to answer the question: \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for readers?\u201d You see, readers are sceptical about giving their email addresses away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For goodness sake, no one wants to get bombarded with spam emails.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to get them in, show them the carrots, the big benefits of why they should sign up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make them feel they have something great to lose if they don\u2019t hop on immediately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you capture them?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use strong and irresistible headlines in your pages and subscription boxes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neil Petal is an expert and demonstrates this clearly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, go ahead and re-write your headlines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-display-social-proof\"> Display Social Proof <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way to win the attention of your readers is to show and prove that your argument is time tested and solid. And you see, people are easily swayed into taking action when they see others doing the same.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I discovered this with my own blog posts over the years. People are more enticed to drop comments if they see others dropping theirs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same goes for subscribers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fix:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Display proof.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prove to them that you are the best person for the topic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tell meaningful stories, do case studies, show social or subscriber counts. You can also display testimonials right before your Optin forms. Quick and easy, right?&nbsp; Next\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-make-it-concrete-and-promising\"> Make It Concrete And Promising <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid using hidden, bland words and sleazy designs. Make your subscription boxes look professional, visible, and promising.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do readers struggle to find your subscription or Optin boxes? Is there a clear call to action? Does it have a magnetic effect?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If yes, then you are doing great; otherwise, rewrite them immediately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-use-the-word-free\"> Use The Word \u201cFREE\u201d <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You are probably thinking why I decided to add this point, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, here it is: If you aren\u2019t using it in your lead magnet, then you are making a huge mistake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The word \u201cfree\u201d is a powerful emotional trigger and a source of irrational excitement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s one of the most powerful words used by copywriters and in the business world to win more clients. It magnetizes and draws in readers. Surprisingly, it also appeals to interest and greed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Used right, it\u2019ll revamp your list building efforts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to see examples?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeff Bullas also uses the same formula on his sidebar Optin boxes and this makes a lot of sense, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The catch though?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use the word with caution and only as occasions demand. Or else? You\u2019ll subconsciously program your readers to never buy anything from you in the future\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bottom line?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use the word in your subscription boxes and pages to maximize clicks, boost sales, and entice your readers into giving you their email addresses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interesting, huh?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-hidden-secret-to-getting-200-optin-rate\"> The Hidden Secret To Getting 200% Optin Rate <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019re probably thinking right now: \u201cDaps if list building is crucial, why isn\u2019t every blogger emphasizing this?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe they don\u2019t want you to know, or more likely, they trust someone else would tell you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And until now, you\u2019ve wandered around in circles looking for that nugget of wisdom that will transform your list building efforts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because, what\u2019s the rationale behind blogging in silence?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s time to begin building your list like a real pro. Focus on those things that give maximum benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it begins by rewriting your copy, check your placements, show benefits.
