Some teasers are strong while others are weak.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see, to get them clicking, you need to find a way to bring them back to consciousness. You need to re-awaken them and get them interested in your offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"532\" src=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/example-of-compelling-photo.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-369\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/example-of-compelling-photo.jpg 800w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/example-of-compelling-photo-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/example-of-compelling-photo-768x511.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not easily granted. But effective email marketing is about you bringing your readers back to life. It\u2019s about walking on their skin. It\u2019s about looking them in the eyes and being brutally honest about situations \u2013 I\u2019ll explain:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-a-dumb-blogger-assumption\">A Dumb Blogger Assumption<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally speaking, bloggers think readers are active waiting for Emails. And it\u2019s ideal to think that way. But in reality, it doesn\u2019t work that way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what happens\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When your email arrives in their email boxes, they sluggishly scroll to see who wins the battle of their attention. they look out for enchanting and value-packed subjects. they look out for open loops in the subject lines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The points:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Successful e-mail teaser works hard to create loops and create irresistible suspense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it\u2019s been proven time and time again that the human brain seeks closure and hates to be suspended.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you think I\u2019m joking? Well, let\u2019s try this out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Switch off your TV set in the middle of an interesting scene!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you feel? Uncomfortable right? You begin to wonder what the hell is happening behind the scene.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart and interesting teasers differentiate you from other sleazy and dumb marketers. They make you stand out in the sea of teaser noises, they position you as an authority, even if you\u2019re not. Great teasers break every form of resistance and get your subscribers in a reading mood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, let me show you how to create email teasers in Under five minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-step-1-pull-them-into-your-party\"> <strong>STEP 1. Pull Them Into Your Party<\/strong> <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your headline is the most important element of your teaser. Screw it up and your campaign is sure to fail. It\u2019s an opportunity to hypnotize and pull your readers into your copy. so it becomes super interesting and powerful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-step-2-give-a-delicious-opening\"> <strong>STEP 2.<\/strong> <strong>Give a Delicious Opening<\/strong> <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Open with a question, a quote or an illustration. The idea behind your opening is to keep your readers glued to your email. Let every sentence droll your readers deeper into your copy<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-step-3-tap-into-present-needs\"> <strong>STEP 3.<\/strong> <strong>Tap Into Present Needs<\/strong> <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Identify the problem your readers are faced with. What pressing problem needs to be solved? what keeps them awake all night? you need to understand your reader\u2019s obsessions and wow them with custom-tailored advice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-step-4-make-it-short-and-simple\"> <strong>STEP 4. Make It Short And Simple<\/strong> <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\u2019t want visitors to get bored reading your mail, do you? You need to make it short, crunchy and simple. If you have more things to say or a lecture in a series, it\u2019s ideal to make it more interesting and entertaining by keeping paragraphs short. As a rule of thumb, your email should be under 5 paragraphs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You Get? Next:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-step-5-give-a-strong-call-to-action\"> <strong>STEP 5. Give A Strong Call To Action<\/strong> <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to avoid vagueness at all costs. Your readers should know specifically what you want them to do. Click a link? Read through the email? Expect the next email answer Or take a survey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If these elements are in place, you instantly hook and pull your readers in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn\u2019t matter if your post is lifeless and empty, it doesn\u2019t matter if you aren\u2019t a perfect writer. And it doesn\u2019t matter if you just woke up from slumber to write. Seriously, follow these techniques and you should win the game of inbox attention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now your emails are ready, the big question is, what will you tell your subscribers?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, let\u2019s look at real examples from professional bloggers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-this-teaser-was-written-by-jonathan-morrow\"> This teaser was written by Jonathan Morrow. <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong><em>Headline:<\/em><\/strong><em> 20 Ways to Be Just Another Mediocre Blogger Nobody Gives a Crap About<\/em><\/p><p>You know what?
