I call them the influential blogger\u2019s blog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-influential-blogger-s-blog\"><strong>The Influential Blogger\u2019s Blog<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what\u2019s so special about these blogs? Because talking about the content you write. Backlinks, you try so hard. So, what\u2019s the secret?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are not entirely perfect, but you\u2019re doing a good job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social Media presence? You are very active in sharing a thing or two.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But your blog is still struggling to take off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ve implemented all the strategies and advice by the <strong>\u201cInterner Gurus\u201d<\/strong> who give advice on the internet on blogging success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So like you, I thought to myself, there must be something about these elite blogs raking in thousands of readers on a daily basis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The worst part?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I settled for a piece of solid and tested advice, which is? To write more content on my blog, but did anything change? <strong>Hell No!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either the experts are not telling us the truth or they are keeping secrets from us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-is-content-truly-king\">Is Content Truly King?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you remember the phrase <strong>\u201ccontent is king\u201d?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that you should write more pillar articles on your blog?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You do, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But after about 13 months of blogging and following this advice, it became clear to me that <em>quantity content<\/em> idea is stupid advice and a complete waste of time for newbie bloggers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why I said content is not always king.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The truth is, blogging has gone far beyond publishing daily content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have over 500 million blogs in existence today and we also have over 2 million blog posts on a daily basis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And out of 2 million, the search engine is only interested in posts that will outsmart the already existing high ranking successful blogs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, as a newbie blogger, you wonder if you have a chance. You wonder if you can outsmart 500 million Blogs overnight. It\u2019s Very possible<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the truth is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The search engine also looks at some factors like domain authority, website authority, Backlinks, Doman Age and others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how do you outrank other sites and rakes in the traffic you need to make income?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not only about content anymore but strategic marketing, what is the use of content if no one is there to read it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>It\u2019s time to wise up and play smart<\/em>, <em>time to be smart and strategic<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-getting-strategic-a-noodle-company-case-study\"><strong>Getting Strategic &#8211; (A Noodle Company Case-Study)<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I know of a noodle company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After their lunch, the noodle company needed a way to break through the highly busy and competitive market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are bringing something new to the market, but no one ever gave them a chance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They hired professional marketers and nothing seems to work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do we sell?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;How do we convince the market that we are introducing is better than our competitors?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They decided to do more aggressive adverts, in every way possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They went ahead and invested more in prints, billboard Ads and of course words of mouth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guess what:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a while, it was all efforts in futility, they still could not gain the attention of their customer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suddenly, a young vibrant marketer gave this suggestion\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>\u201cWhy try reaching the adults with our Noodles?

You are competing with other blogs<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the only way to win is to get strategic and be the master of the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>It is a game &#8211; Play it<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I cannot really overemphasize this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to get dirty,  go outside of yourself. Send that email, follow that authority, buy that course, comment on that blog post &#8211; you must create the relationship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey! you must never play the selfish game. Go there and create genuine relationships, help people. I felt stupid when I had to create time writing a guest post on other people&#8217;s blogs and barely had time for mine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The master player always win!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Develop a strategy for blog growth &#8211; no one stumbles on blog growth, it is most times intentional.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/blogging-strategy.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-243\" width=\"731\" height=\"487\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/blogging-strategy.jpg 640w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/blogging-strategy-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 731px) 100vw, 731px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I am tempted not to write this, but I have to if I want to be sincere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are 1 million and 1 ways to succeed as a blogger, several strategies out there, you have to pick a particular blueprint &#8211; one that has worked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t dabble!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t go from one strategy to another, do your homework well to find a strategy that resonates with you and stick to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another ProBlogger may disagree with my approach to blogging, it doesn&#8217;t make any of us wrong, we just have different strategies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How To Build a Popular Blog From Scratch<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a popular Blog isn\u2019t much of a big deal if you know the working strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real truth is that the strategies are not constant. They keep changing and evolving<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, it used to be strictly content is the king approach. Now, I believe it is more of strategic marketing and social media influencing<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it continues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do you build a large blog audience Blog within 6 Months?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s simple:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stop focusing on your domain name, backlinks, Seo, Facebook, Blog design, pages, categories, videos podcasting &amp; the rest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Truly speaking:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are all a waste of time for newbie loggers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead focus on traffic, pillar and viral contents, links, comments, and building relationships.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others will follow, but for now, this should be your focus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Daps, what about <a href=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/how-to-make-money-from-blogging-in-2021\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">making money<\/a>?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not necessary at your early stage. In fact, stop thinking about making money until you are able to gain at least 1000 subscribers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve not said, bloggers can\u2019t make money until they have huge lists, I made money before I even had 500 subscribers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve only said the focus should be on value and not money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Money will naturally flow into where value is created. We shall come to that but for now, you should focus on blog traffic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>My Blogging Failure &#8211; The Catalyst For Success<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When my blog failed to generate traffic, I thought the wisest thing to do was to pack up. And I actually did.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s the point?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To hell with blogging. It\u2019s not worth the effort.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people asked me what I do for a living? I tell them I\u2019m a blogger. But when I get home, I get so sad with myself, because like the dumb bloggers out there, I was not making a dime, no one cared, it felt like I wrote my blog posts for myself. It\u2019s painful, I must admit.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/blogging-failure-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"blogging-failure\" class=\"wp-image-242\" width=\"750\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/blogging-failure-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/blogging-failure-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/blogging-failure-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/blogging-failure-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/blogging-failure-scaled.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But the joy is that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was not ready to continue in that part of slavery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything inside me wanted blogging success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I needed a more realistic way. I needed a sure and working principle that would take me out of the dark and place me in the part of passive income.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also learned that blogging is strictly business and not journaling. It did a lot of mental shift for me, I shut down the blog, did other businesses while I sought more knowledge about blogging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>&nbsp;<strong>My Greatest Blogging Success Discovery<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In January 2015, I made this discovery that transformed my life. I bought a Success Blogging Course.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was as though I looked into a mirror<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guess what I saw?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I myself applying some useless traffic tips and tricks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I discovered the minor and major traffic channels, the type of content that I needed to write and how to do Seo for my blog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got a quick spike of traffic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only problem:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The relationship-building part for new bloggers is missing in the blueprint.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until I read a post by Tom Treanor on copyblogger. How to<a href=\"http:\/\/www.copyblogger.com\/social-media-networking\/\"> build relationships with other bloggers:<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started implementing the strategies and within 6 months, I had some friends in high places.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My next blog post generated 5201 traffic within 24 hours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I simply ask the influencers I know to help me share the content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sweetest part of the whole story<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>I gained new knowledge<\/li><li>I gained new backlinks; and<\/li><li>I gained new exposure for myself<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The bottom line<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Professional blogging is about connection.
