Some are even willing to pay me to set up one for them, I had to do a video recently on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=O08lCeyUfCM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">setting up auto blogs<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t blame them.

Don\u2019t you think so?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Churning out content, I mean creating good blog content from time to time can be a lonely high hill to climb.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bloggers are turned into slaves without their permission.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-am-i-saying-blog-content-creation-is-wrong\"> Am I Saying Blog Content Creation Is Wrong? <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course not, but for newbie bloggers, it\u2019s wise to focus on relationship building, blogging strategies, rather than posting articles that might end up not been read.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s like shouting in the desert where no one is listening.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let\u2019s see a shocking fact&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know 95% of the earth is covered by water?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shocking right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Literarily, the whole landmass from one continent to another is just 5% of the whole damn earth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you know what is more shocking?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>95% of blogs also fail.

You don\u2019t know how to put all these things together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generating traffic is not as easy as you think.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It all boils down to four things:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding a large and responsive market with potential readers.<\/li><li>&nbsp;Build strong and lasting relationship with influencers in your niche.<\/li><li>Converting those readers into subscribers<\/li><li>Selling your product and services to different segment of your list.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;The result?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one has been able to do the fours things I mentioned above and have not been able to create a fortune blogging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result is simply a life of passive income, business deals and fame.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sound easy right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But am sorry it\u2019s not\u2026 especially if you\u2019ve not gotten up to 1000 subscribers yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-objection-my-lord-what-about-making-money\"> <strong>Objection My Lord, What About Making Money<\/strong>? <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Isn\u2019t it also important?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, the truth is, it\u2019s not important to think of making money at the beginning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Profit is made by selling or offering services, so at the beginning, you have no connections, list or traffic, so stop thinking about money and focus on creating value for other blogs. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I watch some bloggers obsessed with getting Google AdSense approval and after that, they end up not making a dime because they don\u2019t have the type of traffic I want to teach you to gain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might still want to ask, what about search engine optimization and publishing lots of content on directories?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, all those are waste of time too for newbie bloggers and that is where real mentorship comes in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone who understands exactly what you\u2019re going through. Not bloggers who just tell you what to do without actually showing you how to do it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-power-of-a-mentor\"> <strong>The Power Of a Mentor<\/strong> <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You need a mentor, a teacher. Someone to help you overcome the hurdles and point and lead you in the right direction: at least away from  the slavery of blog content creation <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Avoid The Young Zebra\u2019s Ordeal (You Can\u2019t Do It Alone)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember as I watched.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This razor-toothed crocodile was in No mood for mercy after a zebra foal lost its footing while crossing the Mara River in Kenya.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The zebra herds had to cross the river in order to continue their migration to Tanzania in search of fresh grazing.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The rest of the herds successfully made it across, Shepard by a matured zebra. But a solitary young star slipped in deeper water and the croc quickly closed in for the kill. The crocodile went straight for the foal\u2019s neck and after a brief struggle pulled it beneath the surface. The zebra never stood a chance.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Translation:<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other zebras crossed the dangerous River successfully. Why because they had a mentor who led them through the river of death.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The young zebra went alone. He was lonely and he lost his footings and died a painful death.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blogging is no different:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to succeed and overcome? Don\u2019t try to run alone. Don\u2019t try to be a superman.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow a mentor\u2019s advice and do just as you are told. So, that means you must choose your mentor well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A more pressing problem:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-you-have-limited-time-daily-to-do-everything\"> <strong>You Have Limited Time Daily To Do Everything<\/strong> <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You see, you don\u2019t have all the time in the world to do everything<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why you should only focus on things that work at the moment, except if you have 50 hours daily and except you admit been a superman.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can\u2019t do everything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The truth is that you have your blog design to optimize, blog content creation, interviews, guest posting, social media creating infographics and promoting them on Pinterest, writing short posts for Google + commenting on forums and other blogs. Creating podcasts, YouTube videos, writing products and so on<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you do all that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it\u2019s possible but you will end up wearing yourself out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listen:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started, years ago, I had no audience, no backlinks and no reputation online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frankly speaking; I was a nobody starting out as a blogger. I took the advice of building a list in a report on <strong><em>the blog profit blueprint<\/em><\/strong> by Yaro Starek.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Waited for another 7 months before it dawned on me that I was wasting my time online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Would you believe that I started writing on other blogs as a guest author and within 23 days I gained 2108 email lists and more than 803 backlinks?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe just like you, I did all that from scratch, with no credibility, no track records and no attractive blog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was all fueled by the determination to succeed. Was just not ready to give in to \u201c<strong>quantity content on my blog<\/strong>\u201d which is spreading wide in the blogosphere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-so-what-s-the-most-powerful-idea-for-gaining-massive-audience\"> <strong>So What\u2019s The Most Powerful Idea for Gaining Massive Audience<\/strong>? <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not in SEO or more content. It\u2019s in knowing where your audiences are and having the right hook to capture them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forget your blog and start guest posting, just make sure you are making noise on a big platform in your niche. It\u2019s useless posting on your blog ALONE in the beginning when no one is ready to listen to what you have to say.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guest posting will fast-track your credibility and make your feathers strong enough to fly to the world of influential bloggers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use microblogging platforms like Quora, Wikipedia or Medium as well, since they have all the traffic you need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will also gain quality backlinks and subscribers. Isn\u2019t that how the influential bloggers kill it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spoke about <a href=\"https:\/\/highblogtraffic.com\/blogging-success\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the influential bloggers&#8217; traffic flow in this blog post<\/a>, you may want to read it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are real people with experience, knowledge and have graciously crossed the sea of blogging noise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To succeed as a blogger, you need to be real. You need to fearlessly go to them and ask them to help you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there is no easy way to achieve this. Because many of them will not listen to you<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you need to find a way to do either of these things:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1.<\/strong>&nbsp; <strong>Be friends with them<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.<\/strong>&nbsp; <strong>And make them talk about you in every way possible.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-about-seo\"> What about Seo? <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The best backlink strategy you can have is from influential blogs.

It\u2019s simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting attention doesn\u2019t have to be difficult.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 48 laws of powers, Law 5 states clearly that if you want anything from anybody:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should appeal to their interest, not to their mercy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Translation:<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Get them what they want and then ask for a favour.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to get attention and favour, you must find a way to appear on their radar and the simple way to do that is to do the following.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Buy their premium product<\/li><li>Interview them<\/li><li>&nbsp;Guest post for them<\/li><li>Attend their conferences<\/li><li>&nbsp;Be their consulting client<\/li><li>Say nice things about them on social media and tag them<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>And once you do, you\u2019ll appear on their priority list.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s the only secret to building a long-lasting and rewarding relationship that will get them talking about you.
