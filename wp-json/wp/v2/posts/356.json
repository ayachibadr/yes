What\u2019s happening to me? How did I get here?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The engine was taking me down in the waters and honestly, there was no need to cry because no one would even hear me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I remember vividly, holding up a book and a pen\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was horrible because I knew I wasn\u2019t ready to die\u2026 I knew I wasn\u2019t ready to bid the world farewell. I knew I have a future to live for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could this be the end of \u201cgreat\u201d Daps?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was damn scared.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most troubling part?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fear of falling off the cliff (because I almost did) I let go of the book and pen I was holding. I stretch my hands to get them back, but I watch them floating away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I knelt in tears, wishing and praying it\u2019s not real\u2026 could this be the end of my writing? I&#8217;m I being submerged in the sea of the blogosphere? Could this also be the end of my career as a writer?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s sad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I woke up to discover it was a dream.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listen, call it horrible, call it interesting, call it whatever you wish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the truth?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-dreams-they-say-have-the-power-to-come-through\"> <strong>Dreams They Say, Have The Power To Come Through<\/strong> <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I became totally discouraged and for days I was troubled and I soon discovered the joy was gradually dissipating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have truckloads of ideas yearning to see the light of day, but I lost something very crucial and motivating. And I thought so, but I was wrong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe yours is not a dream or lack of time or ideas. And maybe you are one of the best writers in your field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But procrastination has kept you down from starting out<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in your mind, motivation is what you desperately need, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, wrong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-here-s-what-no-one-has-the-courage-to-tell-you\"> <strong>Here\u2019s What No One Has The Courage To Tell You:<\/strong> <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Motivation does not count for much in blogging or any other profession. Yeah, you read that right. What you need to succeed is a form of consistency in learning and acting, so it becomes a part of you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep beating on your craft until your subconscious mind embraces it<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like athletes, they never depend on motivation to win, do they?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Motivation is good and sure it can help you scale over the walls of limitation, but it might not make you a successful writer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to my horrible dream, (7 months) I wasn\u2019t writing anything. I was blogging just for fun, even though I hope to take it forward. But I admit it was all my fault.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe like me, you were fired. You stopped writing<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can bounce back and fight for your ideas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-the-bottom-line\"> The bottom line? <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Consistency<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to succeed, you must keep at what you love. And you know blogging is like a job, you can be suspended, demoted or fired.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Motivation and passion are great, but consistency would eventually take you there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take your blogging and writing like a real business. Yes, avoid taking unlawful breaks and times off your writing hours. Do away with procrastination and shun every voice that keeps whispering failure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The truth is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to be remembered! You also want to stand out in the midst of the crowd! Definitely, you want to bid mediocrity blogging farewell!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stop doing the dumb things everyone else is doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And guess what?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>It\u2019s simple and boils down to holding on and believing in your calling.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have the power within you. You are wise and skilful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you must not allow your dreams to die.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m back and better, churning out more valuable inspirational and unforgettable contents<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By leading a life so unique that I no longer need any motivation to keep me going.&nbsp; And it\u2019s easier than you can imagine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever you feel like you are losing it, stick to the routine and be consistent about the job and Time. And that\u2019s the way out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-big-benefits-of-writing\"> <strong>The Big Benefits Of Writing<\/strong> <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Writers are not ordinary men, they entertain, educate, direct, lead and transform the world through their crafts. Yes, you can also live the life of your dream and without apology, writing is the best profession in the world and here is why\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see, unlike medicine, accounting or law or medicine, writers stay alive even after death, their words live on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here on earth?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Writing opens door to anyone who takes it as a real Job.<\/li><li>You can be a well-paid writer and author with high prestige and honour.<\/li><li>You can be a prominent blogger, earning passive income with a million shares and comments<\/li><li>A celebrity: looking at pro bloggers like Daren Rowse, Brian Clark, Yaro Starek and the rest.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>They are respected across the web and their opinion matters a great deal, above all, the freedom to live the internet lifestyle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blogging can earn you awards, respect and of course gives you the extra time to travel around the world and live the life of your dream.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-truly-matters-at-the-end\"> <strong>What Truly Matters At The End<\/strong> <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not how you lived, it\u2019s not about the reputation and respect accorded to you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We shall all pack up ready to go back to where we came to give an account of all that was given to us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know you shall be ready, not because you choose to be a writer, not because you are smarter than the rest of your kind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But because you know that your life is not about you, but the people you were able to impact with your words.
